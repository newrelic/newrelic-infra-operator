# New Relic Infrastructure Operator for Kubernetes [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/newrelic/newrelic-infra-operator/graph/badge.svg?token=ZZ68U8NEQH)](https://codecov.io/gh/newrelic/newrelic-infra-operator)

This operator automates the injection of the New Relic Infrastructure sidecar on Pods matching the configured policies.

The `newrelic-infra-operator` sets up a `mutatingWebhookConfiguration`, which allows it to modify the Pod objects that are
about to be created in the cluster.

On this event, and when the Pod being created matches the user’s configured policies the operator will:

 - Add a sidecar container to the Pod, containing the New Relic Kubernetes Integration.
 - If a secret containing license key doesn't exist, create it in the same Namespace as the pod,
   since it is needed for the integration to report data.
 - Add the Pod’s service account to a `ClusterRoleBinding` previously created by the operator chart, which will grant this
   sidecar the required permissions to access the Kubernetes metrics endpoints. 
   

The ClusterRoleBinding grants the following permissions to the Pod being injected:
```yaml
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources:
    - "nodes"
    - "nodes/metrics"
    - "nodes/stats"
    - "nodes/proxy"
    - "pods"
    - "services"
      verbs: ["get", "list"]
- nonResourceURLs: ["/metrics"]
  verbs: ["get"]
```

In order to get the sidecar injected on Pods deployed before the operator has been installed, you need to manually
perform a rollout (restart) of the workloads. New Relic has chosen not to do this automatically in order to prevent 
unexpected service disruptions and resource usage spikes.

## Installation

You can install this chart using [`nri-bundle`](https://github.com/newrelic/helm-charts/tree/master/charts/nri-bundle) located in the
[helm-charts repository](https://github.com/newrelic/helm-charts) or directly from this repository by adding this Helm repository:

```shell
helm repo add newrelic-infra-operator https://newrelic.github.io/newrelic-infra-operator
helm upgrade --install newrelic-infra-operator/newrelic-infra-operator -f your-custom-values.yaml
```

Once deployed, it will automatically inject the sidecar in the Pod matching the policy specified.
Only Pods created after the deployment of the monitoring solution will be injected with the configuration and agent.

For further information regarding the installation refer to the official docs and to the `README.md` 
and the `values.yaml` of the [chart](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-infra-operator/tree/master/charts/newrelic-infra-operator).

### Develop, Test and Run Locally

For the development process [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io) and [tilt](https://tilt.dev/) tools are used.

* [Install kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/#installation)
* [Install Tilt](https://docs.tilt.dev/install.html)

#### Building

To build the image:
```sh
GOOS=linux make image
```

To build the binary:
```sh
GOOS=linux make build
```

#### Configure Tilt

If you want to use a `kind` cluster for testing, configure Tilt using the command below:

```sh
cat <<EOF > tilt_option.json
{
  "default_registry": "localhost:5000"
}
EOF
```

If you want to use existing Kubernetes cluster, create `tilt_option.json` file with content similar to below:

```json
{
  "default_registry": "quay.io/<your username>",
  "allowed_contexts": "<kubeconfig context to use>"
}
```

##### Helm chart location

To deploy the operator, the current Tilt configuration expects the New Relic 
[helm-charts](https://github.com/newrelic/helm-charts) repository to be
cloned as a sibling to this repository under the name `helm-charts-newrelic`
This repository is an authoritative source of the deployment manifests for the operator.

If you have `helm-charts` repository cloned into a different path, you can configure Tilt to use it by adding the
following key-value pair to your local `tilt_option.json` file:

```
  "chart_path": "../../helm-charts-newrelic/charts/newrelic-infra-operator/"
```

#### Creating kind cluster

If you want to use a local `kind` cluster for testing, create it with command below:

```sh
make kind-up
```

#### Run

If you use a `kind` cluster, simply run:

```sh
make tilt-up
```

If you deploy on external cluster, run the command below, pointing `TILT_KUBECONFIG` to your `kubeconfig` file:

```sh
TILT_KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/config make tilt-down
```

Now, when you make changes to the code, the operator binary will be built locally, copied to the Pod, and then executed.

#### Testing

##### Unit testing
In order to run unit tests run:
```sh
make test
```
##### Integration and test-e2e testing
In order to run integration and test-e2e tests run:

```sh
make test-integration
make test-e2e
```

Notice that in order to run both integration and test-e2e tests, you will need a working environment available with the
`newrelic-infra-operator` running. 
Both installing the `newrelic-infra-operator` chart or spinning up the environment with `make tilt-up` are possible options.

It is also possible to run such tests against any cluster you have access to by setting the environment variable
`TEST_KUBECONFIG=/your/kube/config/path`. 

##### E2E testing
In order to run E2E tests, read the [E2E README](./e2e/README.md) for more details regarding running E2E tests.
