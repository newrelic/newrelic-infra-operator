# New Relic Infrastructure Operator for Kubernetes

This operator automates injection of the New Relic Infrastructure container.

## Installation

> TBD

## Getting Started

> TBD

## Usage

> TBD

## Building

### Prerequisites

For the development process [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io) and [tilt](https://tilt.dev/) tools are used.

* [Install kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/#installation)
* [Install Tilt](https://docs.tilt.dev/install.html)

### Configuration

If you want to use kind cluster for testing, configure Tilt using the command below:

```sh
cat <<EOF > tilt_option.json
{
  "default_registry": "localhost:5000"
}
EOF
```

If you want to use existing Kubernetes cluster, create `tilt_option.json` file with content similar to below:

```json
{
  "default_registry": "quay.io/<your username>",
  "allowed_contexts": "<kubeconfig context to use>"
}
```

#### Helm chart location

Current Tilt configuration expects New Relic [helm-charts](https://github.com/newrelic/helm-charts) repository to be
cloned as a sibling to this repository under a name `helm-charts-newrelic`, to be able to deploy the operator.
This repository is an authoritative source of the deployment manifests for the operator.

If you have `helm-charts` repository cloned into a different path, you can configure Tilt to use it by adding the
following key-value pair to your local `tilt_option.json` file:

```json
  "chart_path": "../../helm-charts-newrelic/charts/newrelic-infra-operator/"
```

### Creating kind cluster

If you want to use local kind cluster for testing, create it with command below:

```sh
make kind-up
```

### Run

If you use kind cluster, simply run:

```sh
make tilt-up
```

If you deploy on external cluster, run the command below, pointing `TILT_KUBECONFIG` to your `kubeconfig` file:

```sh
TILT_KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/config make tilt-down
```

Now, when you do changes to the code, operator binary will be locally built, copied to the Pod and executed.
